Build your app quickly with Thicket, an ultra-simple PHP MVC 

Thicket is easy to setup and get going. Just find the config.php file in /includes/engine/ and edit the default parameters to fit your own website. 

Editing pages is easy. Thicket comes pre-loaded with a Home (_home.php), About (_about.php), Create (_create.php), and Login/Register (_login.php) page. Just find the one you want and edit the HTML to fit your needs. We've also got a snazzy stylesheet and some minimal JS functionality, but you can edit that too at /includes/css/style.css and /includes/js/script.js respectively.

Thicket includes CSRF protection for the login/register form, newsletter sendouts, spam prevention, and other great features. It's an un-framework, without the clutter or weight of other PHP libraries. You don't have to learn anything - just install it on your web app's home directory and get started!
