					</section>
					<section class='content__info content__info--team'>
						<p>Thicket is easy to setup and get going. Just find the config.php file in /includes/engine/ and edit the default parameters to fit your own website.</p>
						<p>Editing pages is easy. Thicket comes pre-loaded with a Home (_home.php), About (_about.php), Create (_create.php), and Login/Register (_login.php) page. Just find the one you want and edit the HTML to fit your needs. We've also got a barebones stylesheet and some minimal JS functionality (spaghetti JS to get you moving faster, although we recommend refactoring once you push to production), but you can edit that too at /includes/css/style.css and /includes/js/script.js respectively.</p>
						<p>Thicket includes an excellent forum structure, robust login/register form, Disqus comment integration, newsletter sendouts (coming soon!), spam prevention, messaging (still needs work!), and other great features. It's an un-framework, without the clutter or weight of other PHP libraries. You don't have to learn anything - just install it on your web app's home directory and get started!</p>
